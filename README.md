# Elevator Music

Gradle is an awesome Build Tool that has a performance,
but everytime it gets faster we increase its workload.
Because of this, we will spend a long time waiting on
the build. 

Now we can add elevator music with this plugin to the
build to increase the fun while waiting. This plugin
also adds the ability to set a success sound that plays
when the build finishes, so you know when you can resume
working.
